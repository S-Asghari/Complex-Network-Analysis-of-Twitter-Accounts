With the growing rate of social networks, the number of fake accounts and fake news is multiplying day by day. To detect bots, researchers have proposed several approaches, among which we can mention Machine Learning techniques and classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines) which label each user as human or bot. From a different point of view, in every social network users interact with each other in the context of graphs. For example, in Twitter there are graphs of follower-following, comment, retweet, mention, and so on. Thus, a Complex Network is formed that can be analyzed using a set of tools and criteria. The aim of this project is to analyze Complex Networks on real and fake Twitter accounts, in order to examine the behavior of bots compared to humans. After applying several criteria to the implemented graphs, we found some of them effective in separating fake users from real ones, and consequently, we propose they be used to identify fake user accounts.
